## What is variables
1) Variables are containers that store data in a Python program

### Rules of naming variables correctly,
1) You can not use reserve words as variable names (e.g. def, True etc.)
2) Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore _
3) It cannot contain spaces or special characters (@, #, $, %, etc.)
4) Underscore _ is a valid character and can be present at any place in a variable name

## What is numbers 
Numbers are the type of data which gets stored inside varable
### Number types
1) Integer numbers store whole numbers (without decimal part), e.g. 57
2) Float numbers store fractional numbers with whole and decimal part, e.g. 57.23
3) type(variable_name) can be used to detect the data type of a variable
4) / operator is used for division whereas // is used to retrieve integer part of the division
5) % is a module operator, it returns the remainder of a division operation
6) x**y will return x raised to the power of y
7) You can do type casting using functions such as float(), int(), str() etc.
8) float(”10.2”) will convert string value “10.2” to a float value 10.2
9) math is a handy module in Python that allows you to run different functions such as sqrt, floor, ceil etc.

### Example

```python
a=10; b=5.5;
c=a+b
type(a) //Type is used to check datatype
type(b)
```

## What is string
1) In Python, strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.
2) Access specific characters or substrings in Python using indexing (e.g., name[0]) and slicing (e.g., name[1 : 5])
3) Use string formatting techniques like f-strings (e.g., f'{variable}') for easier and more readable string composition in Python
4) Python provides built-in methods for strings, such as .upper(), .lower(), .split(), and .strip()
