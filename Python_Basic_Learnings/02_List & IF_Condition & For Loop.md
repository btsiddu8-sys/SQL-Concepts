## 1) List
01) Lists allow you to store sequential data.
2) Lists are ordered, meaning each item has a fixed position unless explicitly changed.
3) Python lists can hold different data types in asingle list, including numbers, strings, and other
   lists. This means they are heterogeneous. For example my_list = [”car”, 4.5, True]
4) Lists are mutable, allowing for elements to be added, removed, or changed within the same list.
5) List slicing lets you access a specific range of elements quickly, using the syntax list[start : end : step]


### Example
```python
list=['siddu',123,1.34]
```

## 2) IF Condition

## 3) For Loop
